      <h1>LLC vs Sole Proprietorship: Which Business Structure Is Right for You?</h1>
      <p class="text-muted">Deciding between an LLC and a sole proprietorship can shape your business future. Here’s a breakdown to help you choose wisely in 2025.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>When starting a business, one of the first decisions you’ll face is choosing the right structure. For many entrepreneurs, the choice often comes down to two popular options: forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or operating as a Sole Proprietor.</p>

      <p>Both have their advantages and drawbacks. The right option depends on your goals, the level of protection you want, and how you plan to grow. Let’s explore both structures and see which might be the best fit for you.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>What is a Sole Proprietorship?</h2>
    <p>A sole proprietorship is the simplest business structure. It doesn’t require formal registration, and the owner has complete control. However, the downside is that there’s no legal separation between you and your business. If debts or lawsuits arise, your personal assets are at risk.</p>

    <h2>What is an LLC?</h2>
    <p>A Limited Liability Company (LLC) provides legal protection by separating your personal assets from business liabilities. While it involves paperwork and fees, the benefits are often worth it for entrepreneurs looking to build credibility and protect their future.</p>

    <h2>LLC vs Sole Proprietorship: Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Feature</th>
          <th>LLC</th>
          <th>Sole Proprietorship</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Legal Protection</td>
          <td>Owners’ personal assets are protected</td>
          <td>No separation; owner is personally liable</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Startup Costs</td>
          <td>Filing fees and annual reports required</td>
          <td>Minimal or no formal costs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Taxes</td>
          <td>Pass-through taxation (can also elect corporate tax)</td>
          <td>Income is reported on personal tax return</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Credibility</td>
          <td>Seen as more professional and trustworthy</td>
          <td>May seem less formal to clients or investors</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Compliance</td>
          <td>Requires maintaining state compliance</td>
          <td>No ongoing compliance requirements</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Why Many Entrepreneurs Choose LLCs</h2>
    <p>While sole proprietorships are simple and inexpensive, LLCs offer long-term advantages such as liability protection and greater growth potential. To stay compliant, many business owners use professional registered agents.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
